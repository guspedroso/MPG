  <body> <FONT COLOR="ffffff"> Hey guys! Lets see
  if someone can successfully remap the keys to WASD. Space bar for shooting
  seems fine to me. Got the collision mask going so you can kill the enemy.
Soon I will add more sprites to the sheet so we can get him more frames for movement.
I want to get this enemy moving randomly on the map but I need to set a collision layer
for the map so that they are within the bounds. Also want to get the map background
done properly instead of using a repeater. Lets keep working and see what we
can do this spring break! - Gus
